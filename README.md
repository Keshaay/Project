# Topic 5: Implementation of Basic Ciphers

Description: This project aims to demonstrate various simple ciphers, such as the Vernam Cipher, Caesar Cipher, Atbash Cipher, and potentially others, using basic logic gates and flip-flops on the Nexys A7 FPGA board. Each cipher enabling users to input plaintext messages and observe the resulting ciphertext generated by the encryption process. Buttons and switches can serve as input devices for users to input plaintext messages and control the encryption/decryption process. LEDs can provide visual feedback on the status of the encryption/decryption process, indicating ready to receive input, encryption/decryption in progress, and complete. The 7-segment display shows the ciphertext or plaintext output.

## Theoretical description and explanation


### Caesar's Cipher 

Caesar's Cipher consists in shifting the characters in the entered text by the same entered numerical value in the alphabet. For example, if you enter 'hello' and shift is set to 1, then all the characters in this word will be shifted exactly one character forward, i.e. a 'beep' will be produced.

### Vernam Cipher

The Vernam Cipher lies in the entered password. The text is shifted by just as many characters as the individual letters in the password, depending on the sequence. For example, if we enter 'hello' and 'a' as the password, then all the letters in the word will be moved by exactly one -> 'beep' will be created.

### Atbash Cipher

Atbash Cipher is a simple, classic, monoalphabetic substitution cipher, built on one coding table. The basic principle of Atbash is to reverse the order of characters in the encryption table. The first character of the plaintext alphabet thus corresponds to the last character of the cipher alphabet.

## Software description

This design source named top_level has integrates various encryption algorithms with serial communication to implement an input/output interface. The code defines the `top_level` entity with several inputs and outputs and contains several procedures for encryption and decryption, as well as components for signal control and communication. Here is a brief overview of the main components and their functions:

### Entity and Ports
- **Entity `top_level`**: Defines the interface with ports for buttons, a clock, and a serial output.
- **Ports**: Inputs for buttons and a clock signal, and an output for serial communication.

### Encryption Procedures
- **`vernam_encrypt_decrypt`**: A procedure for encrypting and decrypting using the Vernam cipher, where the output is obtained by XORing the bytes of the key and the input text.
- **`ceasar_encrypt` and `ceasar_decrypt`**: Procedures for encrypting and decrypting using the Caesar cipher, where the character shift is achieved by adding or subtracting the value of the `shift` constant.

### Conversion Function
- **`to_std_logic_vector`**: A function to convert a string into `std_logic_vector`, facilitating the handling of text data at the bit level.

### Components
- **`clock_enable` and `debounce`**: Components for generating stable clock signals and eliminating "bounces" on input buttons.
- **`UART_TX_CTRL`**: A component for controlling serial communication.

### Processes and Signals
- **`char_load_process`**: A process for loading encrypted/decrypted data into the UART buffer and controlling data transmission based on button presses and the state of the switch.
- **Signals for indexes and data preparation**: `ltrindex_ceasar`, `ltrindex_vernan`, `uartData`, `uartRdy`, etc., which control which data is being sent and when.

### Overall Function
- The code integrates encryption, decryption, and serial communication into one module. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using Vernam and Caesar ciphers and send them serially via UART. Buttons and switches on the device enable users to interactively select operations and monitor results in real time.
